# How to Use AI to Analyze Stock Fundamentals

Don't have a finance degree? AI can help you analyze stocks like a pro.

## What Are Fundamentals?

Fundamentals are the basic financial metrics that tell you about a company's health:
- Revenue
- Earnings per share (EPS)
- P/E ratio
- Debt
- Cash flow

## AI Tools for Stock Analysis

### 1. ChatGPT
Ask things like:
- "What's Apple's revenue growth over 5 years?"
- "Compare Microsoft's P/E ratio to Google's"

### 2. Finviz
- Free stock screener
- AI-powered filtering
- Visual charts

### 3. Yahoo Finance AI
- AI summaries of earnings calls
- Smart company comparisons

### 4. Seeking Alpha
- AI-powered article summaries
- Quantitative ratings

## Step-by-Step Analysis

### Step 1: Pick a Stock
Let's use Apple (AAPL) as an example.

### Step 2: Ask AI About Revenue
Prompt: "What has Apple's revenue been for the last 5 years?"

### Step 3: Check Profitability
Prompt: "What's Apple's profit margin and EPS?"

### Step 4: Evaluate Valuation
Prompt: "Is Apple's current P/E ratio high or low compared to its historical average?"

### Step 5: Assess Debt
Prompt: "What's Apple's total debt to equity ratio?"

## Red Flags to Watch For

- ❌ Declining revenue
- ❌ High debt levels
- ❌ P/E ratio much higher than industry average
- ❌ Negative cash flow

**Remember:** AI is a tool to assist your research, not replace it entirely.
