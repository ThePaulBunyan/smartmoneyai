# AI Automation for Insurance Agencies

Insurance agencies deal with:
- Quote requests
- Policy renewals
- Claims processing
- Client communication

All of this can be automated.

## What to Automate

### 1. Quote Requests
AI can:
- Collect client info
- Generate quotes
- Send follow-ups
- Schedule appointments

### 2. Policy Renewals
AI can:
- Send renewal reminders
- Update policy details
- Process payments
- Send confirmation

### 3. Claims Processing
AI can:
- Initial claims intake
- Gather documentation
- Status updates
- Escalation handling

## The Numbers

| Task | Manual Time | With AI |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Quotes | 2 hours/day | 15 min/day |
| Renewals | 1 hour/day | 10 min/day |
| Follow-ups | 30 min/day | Automated |

## How to Start

1. **Day 1-2:** Connect email to OpenClaw
2. **Day 3-4:** Build quote response workflow
3. **Day 5-7:** Add renewal automation

## Cost to Implement

- OpenClaw: Free
- Setup time: 5-10 hours
- Monthly: Basically nothing

## The Opportunity

There are 5+ million small businesses in the US. Most need help with automation.

You could:
- Build AI systems for them
- Charge $500-2,000 setup
- Charge $200-500/month management

**This is a massive opportunity.**
