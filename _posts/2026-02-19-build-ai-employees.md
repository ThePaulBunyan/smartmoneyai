# How to Build AI Employees for Your Business

Your first AI employee costs less than hiring a virtual assistant. Here's how to build one.

## What is an AI Employee?

An AI employee is an OpenClaw agent that handles specific business tasks:
- Responding to customer inquiries
- Processing orders
- Scheduling appointments
- Managing data entry

## How to Build Your First AI Employee

### Step 1: Choose a Workflow
Pick one repetitive task:
- Customer support
- Email management
- Data entry
- Appointment scheduling

### Step 2: Define the Process
Map out exactly what the task involves:
1. Trigger (what starts the task)
2. Actions (what the AI does)
3. Output (what happens next)

### Step 3: Set Up OpenClaw
```
Give your AI employee:
- A specific role
- Clear instructions
- Access to needed tools
```

### Step 4: Train and Refine
- Start with simple tasks
- Add complexity over time
- Monitor performance

## What AI Employees Can Do Now

| Task | Time Saved/Week |
|------|-----------------|
| Email responses | 10-15 hours |
| Customer support | 20-30 hours |
| Data entry | 5-10 hours |
| Scheduling | 3-5 hours |

## The Cost

- OpenClaw: Free
- Your time: ~5 hours setup
- Ongoing: Almost nothing

## Next Steps

1. Identify one task to automate
2. Map out the workflow
3. Build your first AI employee
4. Scale from there
